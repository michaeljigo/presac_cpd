bandwidth: adjust only neutral trials

Task 1: Find the densities (thresholding)
- detection
- get densities for 0, 4 and 8 deg
- 0.2:0.1:0.8 - densities tested
- no colored dots
- 3 ecc x 7 densities x 45 trials x 2 presence


Task 2: Test eye movements (main)
- cues: + = right, - = left, o = fixation
- cue colors: green (short saccade), purple (long saccade), white (neutral)
- tested eccentricities: -10:2:10 (collapse across eccentricity)
- cued eccentricities: 4, 8 deg
- 3 densities: one for each eccentricity determined in task 1
- 6 ecc x 3 cue ecc x 3 densities x 2 presence x 60 trials
- intermixing densities

Future versions:
- we can block densities
