Task 3 information:
updated 05.04.21

Purpose:    Assess whether the preferred density found in a 2AFC 
            discrimination task generalizes and reaches peak performance
            at the same eccentricity in a detection task.
Goal:       Test generalizability of CPD between discrimination and 
            detection tasks.

Task:       Measured performance in yes-no detection task.
            Observers reported target presence (yes or no).

Stimuli:    4 eccentricities (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 deg)
            1 density (preferred, as deteremined by model)

Subjects:   MJ
            NH
