Purpose:    Find preferred line density for peripheral stimuli. 
Goal:       Characterize preferred line density across eccentricity.

Task:       Measured performance in 2-spatial-AFC task.
            Observers reported target location (left or right of fixation).

Stimuli:    4 eccentricities (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 deg)
            7 densities (0.25 0.4 0.55 0.7 0.85 1 1.15 dva/row)
