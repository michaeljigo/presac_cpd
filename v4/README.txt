bandwidth: fixed at 125 degrees. It is fixed because we are blocking size and do not want to deal with titrating bandwidth across blocks.

Task 1: Find the size (thresholding)
- detection
- get sizes for 0, 4 and 8 deg
- 6 sizes - 3:2:13 - sizes tested; square sizes (e.g. 3x3)
- 6 eccentricities (0:2.5:12.5)
- colored dots
- 1 line-to-line spacing: 0.305
- 6 ecc x 1 density x 6 sizes x 45 trials x 2 presence
- we're finally blocking size!
