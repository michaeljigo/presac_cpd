Task 4 information:
updated 05.10.21

Purpose:    Test how programmed eye movements affect texture segmentation 
            at and away from the target location.
            
Task:       Measured performance in yes-no detection task.
            Observers reported target presence (yes or no).
            Observers also make eye movements

Stimuli:    4 eccentricities (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 deg)
            1 density (preferred, as deteremined by model)

Subjects:   MJ
            NH
